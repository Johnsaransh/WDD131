			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Our website serves as a bridge between manufacturers worldwide and sustainable raw materials sourced from India. We aim to provide high-quality, ethically sourced materials that support industries in achieving their production goals while fostering responsible trade practices. By connecting global manufacturers with trusted Indian suppliers, we promote environmental sustainability, economic growth, and reliable partnerships, ensuring a seamless sourcing experience tailored to the needs of modern industries.</p>
			

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Age: 30–60 (typically professionals in manufacturing or procurement roles).
                Location: International businesses outside India, with interest in Indian materials for affordability and quality.
                Education/Expertise: Industry professionals with technical knowledge of raw materials or sustainable sourcing practices.</p>
			

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>JavaScript will be used to add interactivity and dynamic elements to the website, enhancing the user experience. A real-time search bar will allow users to find raw materials quickly, while dynamic filtering options will enable them to sort products by category, price, and availability. For pricing, JavaScript will fetch real-time currency conversion rates and update material prices accordingly. Modal pop-ups will display detailed product information without navigating away from the page, and form validation will ensure that inquiry forms are filled out correctly. The site will also feature infinite scrolling for loading products as users scroll, and a notification system will provide instant feedback for form submissions and price updates. A carousel will showcase featured products, while real-time feedback like star ratings will engage users. Additionally, a dark mode toggle will offer a customizable visual experience. These JavaScript-driven features will make the website more interactive, user-friendly, and responsive, catering to the needs of global manufacturers sourcing raw materials from India.</p>
